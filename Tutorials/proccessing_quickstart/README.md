//This is a comment it starts with two forward slashes the computer does not read this
//It is a great way to write notes to yourself or to others reading your code.
//Play around with this stuff change the numbers, break it, fix it, have fun!

size(400,400); // size() tells the computer what size to make the sketch in pixels.
background(255,0,0); //You guessed it this is the background color the three numbers are the amount of red, blue and green.
rect(200,200,50,50); // rect() draws a rectangle
fill(160,100,120); // our budy fill here is in charge of changing the fill color of the shapes notice how it does'nt change the color of the shape before it.
ellipse(100,200,50,50); // ellipse() draws a circle
//line(50,200,26,9); // yep this is a line to make this work you need to 'uncomment' this code(delete the forward slashes at the begining of this line.
fill(255,255,255);
text("Hello World!!",120,30);// text() is a great way to write text to the screen!

// There are lots of other cool functions you can find them here file:///home/karpov/Downloads/processing-3.2.1/modes/java/reference/index.html
